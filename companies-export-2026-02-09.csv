   Private Markets Data & Analytics provider CEPRES has been a privately owned, independent business for nearly 15 years.

In parallel, private markets investing has exploded, creating massive tailwinds for the business and presumably leading to massive growth in the company’s data exchange and client base. Asymmetrix’s view is that the timing is right for CEPRES to consider a sale.
